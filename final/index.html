                        The board does not start with totally random lights, because some random
                        patterns in Lights Out cannot be solved. This game starts from an all-off
                        board and applies random simulated clicks using the same rules as the
                        player. Any board created this way is guaranteed to be solvable.

                        To meet the “font craziness” requirement, this page uses Google Fonts:
                        <strong>Press Start 2P</strong> for the title and <strong>Orbitron</strong>
                        for the rest of the text. They are loaded with an <code>@import</code> at
                        the top of <code>styles.css</code>:
                    </p>
                    <p class="code-snippet">
                        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Press+Start+2P&amp;family=Orbitron:wght@500&amp;display=swap');
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the page loads, the browser downloads these fonts from Google and
                        applies them to the elements styled in the CSS.

            <p>
                This project implements a playable Lights Out game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                The board is generated dynamically, and each tile toggles itself and its neighbors
                when clicked. To ensure the game is solvable, I began with an all-off board and
                applied random simulated clicks, which guarantees a valid configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game shows the required "You win!" alert when all lights are off. I added small
                embellishments such as a move counter and a status message to make the gameplay feel
                more interactive. I also used Google Fonts to satisfy the font requirement and
                included the footer script to display the last modified time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, styling, and
                deploying a webpage through GitHub Pages.
