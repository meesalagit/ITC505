                <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Objective:</strong> Turn all the lights off. A light is considered “off”
                    when the square is completely dark.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Basic play:</strong> Clicking a square toggles that square and its
                    up, down, left, and right neighbors. Yellow tiles are ON, dark tiles are OFF.
                    When every tile is dark, a pop-up will say <strong>“You win!”</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Hint:</strong> The board you see is not purely random. The game starts
                    from an all-off board and then applies random valid moves using the same rules
                    as the player. Because these are legal moves, the final pattern is always
                    solvable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Font notes:</strong> This page uses the retro arcade font
                    <em>Press Start 2P</em> for the title and a clean sans-serif font for the body
                    text. Both fonts are loaded from Google Fonts using a CSS
                    <code>@import</code> rule at the top of <code>styles.css</code>, which creates
                    the intentional “font craziness” required by the assignment without showing the
                    full URL to the user.

            <p>
                This project implements a playable Lights Out game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                The board is generated dynamically, and each tile toggles itself and its neighbors
                when clicked. To ensure the game is solvable, I began with an all-off board and
                applied random simulated clicks, which guarantees a valid configuration created by
                real game moves.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game shows the required "You win!" alert when all lights are off. I added small
                embellishments such as a move counter and a status message to make the gameplay feel
                more interactive. I also used Google Fonts to satisfy the font requirement and
                included the footer script to display the last modified time of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, styling with CSS,
                and deploying a webpage through GitHub Pages while debugging issues like caching and
                file-path problems.
