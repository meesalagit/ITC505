            <p>
                This project implements a playable Lights Out game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                The board is generated dynamically, and each tile toggles itself and its neighbors
                when clicked. To ensure the game is solvable, I began with an all-off board and
                applied random simulated clicks, which guarantees a valid configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game shows the required "You win!" alert when all lights are off. I added small
                embellishments such as a move counter and a status message to make the gameplay feel
                more interactive. I also used Google Fonts to satisfy the font requirement and
                included the footer script to display the last modified time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, styling, and
                deploying a webpage through GitHub Pages.
