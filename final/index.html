                <p>
                    The puzzle does not start with a completely random pattern, because some random
                    boards in Lights Out are impossible to solve. Instead, the game begins from an
                    all-off board and the program simulates a series of random valid clicks using
                    the same rules as the player. Any board created this way can always be solved,
                    so each new game is both random and solvable.

                    To satisfy the “font craziness” requirement, this page uses Google Fonts,
                    including <strong>Press Start 2P</strong> for the retro title and
                    <strong>Orbitron</strong> for the rest of the text. The fonts are loaded using
                    an <code>@import</code> statement at the top of <code>styles.css</code>:
                </p>
                <p class="code-snippet">
                    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Press+Start+2P&family=Orbitron:wght@500&display=swap');
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the page loads, the browser downloads these fonts from Google’s servers
                    and applies them to the elements styled in the CSS rules.

            <p>
                This project implements a playable Lights Out game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                The board is generated dynamically, and each tile toggles itself and its neighbors
                when clicked. To ensure the game is solvable, I began with an all-off board and
                applied random simulated clicks, which guarantees a valid configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game shows the required "You win!" alert when all lights are off. I added small
                embellishments such as a move counter and a status message to make the gameplay feel
                more interactive. I also used Google Fonts to satisfy the font requirement and
                included the footer script to display the last modified time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, styling, and
                deploying a webpage through GitHub Pages.
